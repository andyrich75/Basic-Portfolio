    <!--stuff about me -->
    <p>Currently work full time at a local insurance company. I have worked for the same employer now for 23 years starting in the mail room and worked my way up to Principle Cybersecurity Engineer. I am always looking for a new challenge and constantly learning new skills.  I am married with three kids who keep me on my toes all the time. I enjoy building furniture and brewing my own beer when I have some downtime and not busy with work. 
        My current mew challenge is to learn coding and start to apply my new skills at work.
